    "With the increasing comparison behaviour due to the constant flow of information from the internet and social media, coupled with the lack of physical social interactions, there is an increasing trend in both depression and loneliness among younger millennials [[1]](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/millennial-depression-on-the-rise#Is-social-media-to-blame?). As a data scientist working in a mental healthcare institutition, we are interested to first explore the top 10 differences in word expression between depression and loneliness behavioural through the social media forum. We will be using 4 types of models namely the null model, multinomial naive bayes, k-nearest neighbours and logistic regression to predict the identification of depression and loneliness of the social media forum. Of these models, we will select the model that are able to provide the highest accuracy with more than 80% that takes into the account of the similarity between depression and loneliness. This will allows us to gain an insight to understand the early behavioural symptoms through their words usage and instill this as part of the assessment and identification when communicating with person in need and provide better assistance through other communication means including the chatbox and the helpline with the model built with more than 80% accuracy."

    "Depression and loneliness are terms that are often associated together due to the common belief that loneliness is a subset of depression and they have high similarity such as the symptoms of being in pain and helplessness [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4225959/). \n",
    "However, the main distinction between depression and loneliness is loneliness is a transient emotional state that corresponds to a person needs for belonging and connection while depression is a mental health condition that can significantly affect a person's ability to function normally with its persistent negative feelings of emptiness, worthlessness, hopelessness and sadness [[3]](https://www.healthline.com/health/loneliness-and-depression) [[4]](https://www.mentalhelp.net/depression/hotline/). Loneliness condition can be improved should those needs be met, while depression on the other hand, requires treatment and can lead to suicidal on severe cases [[5]](https://salienceneuro.com/long-term-effects-of-depression-2/). Nevertheless, a person experiencing loneliness should not be left unattended as it is an indicator of social well-being and prolonged loneliness can also lead to other mental health conditions including depression [[3]](https://www.healthline.com/health/loneliness-and-depression). Hence, it is important to distinguish the differences of loneliness and depression to allow for early detection and offer the appropriate treatment to combat this before it prolonged to undesire consequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Globally, depression is ranked as the single largest contributor to global disability by World Health Organization (WHO) whereby, it is estimated to exceed 300 million people (4.4% of the world's population) having depression in 2015 and it is a major contributor to suicide deaths (up to 800 thosands per year) [[6]](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/depression-global-health-estimates). The high prevalence rate of depression and suicidal is due to barrier to effective care including stigma surrounding mental disorders, lack of awareness and inaccurate assessment  [[7]](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression). With the increase usage of internet and social media, there is an increasing trend in both depression and loneliness among younger millenials in which the usage of these platforms encourage unintentional comparison behaviour with their peers and instill a sense of disconnect from real-life social interaction[[8]](https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6646&context=open_access_etds). This leave them feeling insecure and unaccomplished, thus resulting in lower self-esteem, anxiety and depression. Thus, it is important to create awareness and reachout to them by being available and accessible for support or assistance should they experience depression or loneliness, which is a factor leading to depression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, as a data scientist working in a mental healthcare institutition, I will be handling on this project and our goals are the following:\n",
    "1. To identify the top 10 differences between depression and loneliness behavioural through the word expression in social media forum\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To build models such as null model, multinomial naive bayes, k-nearest neighbours and logistic regression to predict the identification of depression and loneliness behavioural with using the social media forum as a platform to measure the accuracy of the model prediction in this identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To select a model among the models built with the highest accuracy and having more than 80% accuracy to predict the identification of depression and loneliness behavioural in the social media forum, with taking an account of the similarity of depression and loneliness. A recent study suggests that 18% of the loneliness is responsible for depression in older adults. [[9]](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201109184947.htm). As the quantitative measurement of loneliness responsible for depression in young adults are not commonly studied, we will use 20% as a benchmark with reference to the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "By knowing top 10 words that differences that distinguish the depression and loneliness behaviourial, the mental institution will be able to use this insight to instill these words as part of their assessment or identification and offer help when communicating with person in need. In addition, the model built with more than 80% accuracy will enable to provide a better assistance through other communication means including chatbox and the helpline."

For each forum, we will collect 1000 posts from the website using api.pushshift.io (https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/) for each collection and the remaining posts to top up to 5000 posts.
